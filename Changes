Revision history for File-Unsaved

0.04    2014-12-24 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add support for 'mc' editor. Its temporary symlink is the same as
          'joe' so when we cannot determine further, the result's 'editor' key
          will be set to 'joe/mc'.

        - Add options: check_pid & check_proc_name, activated by default. To
          avoid false positive, now by default also checks that PID exists and
          check that process name is the same as editor name (but only when
          Proc::Find module is available).
